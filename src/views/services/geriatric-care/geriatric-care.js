                As we age, access to quality healthcare becomes even more of a
                priority. At Mayflower Medical Group, we are well-equipped to
                care for the needs of our aging patients.
                <br />
                <br />
                We offer specialized medical and psychiatric services, and have
                geriatric professionals on our team that can assist older adults
                and their families in making healthcare decisions that are in
                the best interest of the patient.
                <br />
                <br />
                We foster an environment where patients and their families feel
                comfortable asking questions and voicing concerns or fears. Our
                physicians encourage open discussions about treatment plans and
                recommendations.
